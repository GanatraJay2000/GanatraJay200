## 🚀 Introduction

In the world of ones and zeros, I find joy in crafting elegant code and meaningful applications. Originating from the vibrant streets of Mumbai, my coding journey led me to Syracuse University, where I'm deepening my understanding of Computer Science. From deciphering cryptic codes to building user-friendly interfaces, I've embraced the diverse challenges that the tech realm offers.

## 💻 Technical Toolkit

Explore my proficiency in languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, Python, and more. I wield frameworks like React.js, Vue.js, and Flutter with finesse. SQL databases bow to my queries, and the cloud is a realm I comfortably navigate.

## 🚧 Projects

- **Campus Shuttle Pilot Project:** Implemented enhancements to a shuttle system using Java, Spring, optimizing efficiency and user experience.
